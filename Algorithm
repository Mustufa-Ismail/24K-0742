Question 1: 

1.Start 
2.Ask user a number  
3.Set i=2 
4.Check if the number == 1, if yes then go to step 8, else go to step 5. 
5.Check If number % i == 0, then go to step 8, else go to step 6 
6.Increase i by 1  
7.If i > sqrt of number, then go to step 9, else go to step 5 
8.Display “number is not a prime number” 
9.Display “number is a prime number” 
10.End 

 Question 2: 

1.Start 
2.Ask the user for day number 
3.Set Remainder = (day number % 7) 

4.If remainder == 0, Print “Sunday” 
5.If remainder == 1, Print “Monday” 
6.If remainder == 2, Print “Tuesday” 
7.If remainder == 3, Print “Wednesday” 
8.If remainder == 4, Print “Thursday”
9.If remainder == 5, Print “Friday” 
10.If remainder == 6, Print “Saturday” 
11.End 

Question 3: 
 
1.	Start
2.	Ask the user for num1
3.	Ask the user for num2
4.	Set r = 0
5.	If b = 0, if true, then go to step 9, else go to step 6
6.	 r = a % b 
7.	Change a to b and change b to r
8.	Check if b == 0, if true, then go to step 9, else go to step 6
9.	Print “a is the GCD of both numbers”
10.	End
